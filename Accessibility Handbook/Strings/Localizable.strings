So, a while later, I took what I learned and decided to bring it into the world! Rewriting the contents, adding UIKit and SwiftUI versions to make something really fresh and nice.";
"AboutTheApp.History.text3" = "I always thought the information about accessibility was always there, but you had to know what to look for.";
"AboutTheApp.History.text4" = "That's where this handbook comes, it's something that can be collaborative, easy to use, and fast to find! It's an app! You can carry it around with you and read anytime.";
"AboutTheApp.History.text5" = "It's mostly based on my experiences as a developer, with real-life examples that (I hope) will help you understand more about Accessibility and also help you use in your own projects!";

"AboutTheApp.Game.title" = "What about the Game?";
"AboutTheApp.Game.text1" = "The Handbook was pretty nice and all... but it was a little boring.";
"AboutTheApp.Game.text2" = "So I tryied to make something that would be nicer to use and to learn,";
"AboutTheApp.Game.text3" = "And what best way to do that than with a game?";

// Color blindness

"ColorBlind.Handle.text2" = "Here, on the first column, we are color coding red the negative items and green the positive ones. But that's exactly what we want to avoid. The second Colum has a much better 'universal' experience where identifying these items as positive or negative does not rely solely on color.";
"ColorBlind.Handle.comment1" = "Using + and - may have cultural connotations, so it may not be the best example here. But it's just an example.";
"ColorBlind.Handle.comment2" = "If you do rely on colors only on some part of your app, don't want to change it, but still want to to make it usable for colorblind users, check our 'Differentiate without colors' page.";

// Contrast

"Contrast.comment1" = "But why talk about contrast on an accessibility context?";
"Contrast.text2" = "Contrast is important when taking colors on your applications. Everything that should be visible should be well... Visible.";
"Contrast.text3" = "By that I mean you should be areful when adding colored text on top of colored backgrounds. The base good contrast is black-on-white (or white-on-black) text.";
"Contrast.comment2" = "But is also depends on the font itself, the font's weight...";

"Contrast.Example.text1" = "A nice way to test for contrast is using the WCAG contrast guide";
"Contrast.Example.comment1" = "WCAG stands for 'Web Content Accessibility Guidelines', and I know it's more directed to web, not mobile environments, but that's also nice to take a look into, specially if you are interested in learning more about contarst in accessibility.";
"Contrast.Example.example1" = "This example above fails the WCAG test for contrast.";
"Contrast.Example.example2" = "This one does kida ok, so you can use this color combination with larger fonts.";
